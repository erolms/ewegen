# ADR0001 - Architectural Decision Record: eWegen (Ehrenamtswegen)

## Context

Our organization aims to develop a comprehensive management system for a charity organization run by volunteers. The system, named eWegen (Ehrenamtswegen - Mitglieder Management Plattform), needs to handle membership data, recurring payments, project fulfillment, and communication with members, while ensuring compliance with GDPR regulations. Given the volunteer-based nature of the organization, the system must be reliable, easy to maintain, and cost-effective.

## Problem Statement

We need a technical solution that enables:

- Efficient management of membership data and recurring payments
- Fulfillment tracking of support projects
- Secure member communication
- GDPR compliance and proper data retention
- Scalability and extensibility for future requirements
- Easy maintenance by volunteer staff with varying technical expertise
- Offline capabilities to accommodate volunteers working in various conditions
- Comprehensive documentation to support onboarding of new volunteers

## Options Considered

### Option 1: Monolithic Application

- **Pros**: Simpler deployment, integrated codebase, potentially easier to maintain by small team
- **Cons**: Less scalable, harder to extend, technology constraints, difficult to distribute work

### Option 2: Two-Tier Architecture (Frontend + Backend)

- **Pros**: Clearer separation of concerns, better scalability than monolith
- **Cons**: Less domain separation, limited optimization for different services

### Option 3: Three-Tier Architecture with Domain-Specific Services

- **Pros**: Clear separation of concerns, optimized technology per domain, high scalability, distributed development
- **Cons**: More complex deployment, requires stronger DevOps practices, higher initial development time

### Database Options

1. **Relational Database (PostgreSQL, MySQL)**
   - **Pros**: Mature, strong consistency, powerful queries
   - **Cons**: Less scalable, potentially higher hosting costs

2. **Document Database (DynamoDB)**
   - **Pros**: Scalable, flexible schema, AWS integration, cost-effective
   - **Cons**: Less mature query capabilities, eventual consistency challenges

## Decision

We have decided to implement a three-tier architecture with domain-specific services for eWegen:

1. **Frontend**:
   - Static TypeScript application using React/Gatsby
   - TailwindCSS for styling
   - Focus on accessibility, internationalization, and responsive design
   - Offline capabilities with local data synchronization

2. **Backend for Frontend (BFF)**:
   - TypeScript with Node.js runtime
   - API gateway pattern to communicate with domain services
   - Authentication/authorization via AWS Cognito

3. **Domain-Specific Backend Services**:
   - Golang microservices for optimal performance and memory usage
   - Grouped by bounded contexts (membership, payments, projects, communications)
   - RESTful API design documented with OpenAPI v3
   - Running as rootless Docker containers

4. **Data Persistence**:
   - DynamoDB as primary database
   - Document-based data model following NoSQL best practices
   - GDPR-compliant data retention (archive inactive after 30 days, delete after 10 years)

5. **Infrastructure & Services**:
   - AWS Cognito for authentication/authorization
   - AWS SES for email communications
   - CI/CD via GitHub Actions
   - Security scanning and static analysis in pipeline

6. **Development Practices**:
   - Test-driven development with comprehensive test coverage
   - Trunk-based development with semantic versioning
   - Continuous delivery to production
   - Pair programming for code reviews
   - Decoupled architecture to allow component interchangeability
