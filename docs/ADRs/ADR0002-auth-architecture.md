# ADR0002 - Authentication/Authorization Architecture

## Status
Accepted

## Date
[Current Date]

## Context
The Charity Management System requires a robust, secure authentication and authorization system that supports:
- A volunteer-based organization with various permission levels
- Secure access to member and payment data
- Integration with both frontend and backend components
- Offline capabilities with synchronization
- Integration with the broader AWS ecosystem
- Compliance with GDPR and security best practices

The authentication system will serve as the gatekeeper for all user interactions with the system and must balance security, usability, and flexibility.

## Problem Statement
We need to design an authentication and authorization architecture that:
1. Provides secure user authentication with standard features (login, registration, password reset)
2. Supports role-based access control for different volunteer types
3. Integrates with our chosen frontend and backend technologies
4. Can function in offline scenarios with appropriate security measures
5. Minimizes development and maintenance overhead
6. Allows for potential changes to authentication requirements over time

## Options Considered

### Option 1: Direct AWS Cognito Integration
- **Description**: Tightly integrate AWS Cognito into both frontend and backend, using Cognito-specific libraries and SDK calls directly in application code.
- **Pros**:
  - Fastest implementation path
  - Direct access to all Cognito features
  - Simplified initial development
- **Cons**:
  - High vendor lock-in
  - Difficult to change providers later
  - Cognito-specific code throughout the application

### Option 2: Abstracted Authentication Layer with Cognito Implementation
- **Description**: Create a provider-agnostic authentication layer that uses Cognito as the implementation but isolates Cognito-specific code.
- **Pros**:
  - Balances development speed with flexibility
  - Clearer separation of concerns
  - Easier to change providers if needed
  - Better testability through abstractions
- **Cons**:
  - Additional architectural complexity
  - Some initial development overhead
  - Potential for abstraction leaks

### Option 3: Custom Authentication Server
- **Description**: Build our own authentication server using open-source libraries and custom code.
- **Pros**:
  - Full control over authentication logic
  - No vendor lock-in
  - Potentially lower operating costs
- **Cons**:
  - Significant development effort
  - Security risks if not implemented correctly
  - Ongoing maintenance burden
  - Unnecessary reinvention of solved problems

## Decision
We will implement **Option 2: Abstracted Authentication Layer with Cognito Implementation**, using the following architectural components:

1. **AuthService**: A facade providing a unified API for authentication operations
2. **CognitoAdapter**: An adapter implementing AWS Cognito integration details
3. **TokenManager**: A service handling JWT validation and refresh logic
4. **PermissionEvaluator**: A component for determining access rights based on roles and claims
5. **AuthContextProvider**: Frontend authentication state management
6. **AuthMiddleware**: Backend request authorization validation

The architecture will use the following patterns:
- Adapter Pattern to isolate Cognito-specific code
- Facade Pattern to simplify the auth interface
- Strategy Pattern to support multiple authentication methods
- Decorator Pattern for authorization checks
- Observer Pattern for authentication state changes

## Consequences

### Positive
- **Balanced Approach**: We gain the benefits of a managed authentication service while maintaining architectural flexibility
- **Clear Boundaries**: Authentication logic is isolated from business logic
- **Future-Proofing**: The system can adapt to changing authentication requirements
- **Testability**: Authentication components can be tested with mock implementations
- **Standardization**: Using standard OAuth/OIDC flows improves interoperability

### Negative
- **Development Overhead**: More initial design and implementation work compared to direct integration
- **Potential Complexity**: More moving parts than a direct implementation
- **Abstraction Maintenance**: Need to keep abstractions aligned with evolving requirements
- **Cognito Constraints**: Still subject to Cognito's limitations for core authentication flows

## Related Decisions

### BFF Layer Responsibility
The Backend-for-Frontend (BFF) layer will handle token exchange, validation, and refreshing, acting as a security gateway between the frontend and backend services. This centralizes authentication logic and prevents direct Cognito API access from frontend code.

### Offline Authentication Approach
For offline scenarios, we will implement:
1. Securely stored refresh tokens with appropriate expiration
2. Cryptographically signed JWTs for offline validation
3. Limited permission scope when operating offline
4. Synchronization of authentication state when connectivity is restored

### Token Storage Strategy
- Browser: Refresh tokens in secure HTTP-only cookies
- Local Storage: Limited session data with appropriate expiration
- Mobile/Desktop: Secure device storage with encryption

## Compliance & Security Considerations
- Regular security audits of authentication implementation
- GDPR compliance for user data stored in Cognito
- Implementation of security best practices (MFA, password policies, etc.)
- Clear user consent for data storage and processing

## Implementation Notes
- We will implement the core authentication layer as a shared TypeScript library used by both frontend and backend
- The Cognito implementation will be isolated in adapter classes
- Authentication interfaces will follow OAuth/OIDC standards where possible
- We will create comprehensive testing patterns for authentication components
