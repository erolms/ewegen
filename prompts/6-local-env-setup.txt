lease help me setup the local development environment for all involved frameworks, based on project architectural decisions. Please include suggestions for TDD based tools and frameworks to implement along with development frameworks. Explain me how you made the choices, including some pros and cons. Also, suggest me an initial folder structure to facilitate the development and break into managable and meaningful unit.
