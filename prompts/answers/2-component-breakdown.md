Based on your architectural decisions, here's a recommended logical development order for the components:

1. **Core Infrastructure Setup**
   - Authentication/Authorization (AWS Cognito)
   - CI/CD Pipeline (GitHub Actions)
   - Base Docker container configurations
   - Development environment setup

2. **Data Layer Components**
   - DynamoDB schema design
   - Data access patterns
   - GDPR compliance mechanisms

3. **Backend Core Services**
   - Member Management Service
   - API Gateway/BFF Layer
   - Observability Framework

4. **Frontend Foundation**
   - UI Component Library
   - Authentication Flow
   - Internationalization Framework
   - Offline Capability Core

5. **Payment Processing**
   - Payment Management Service
   - Recurring Payment Scheduler

6. **Project Management**
   - Project Tracking Service
   - Fulfillment Management

7. **Communication System**
   - Email Service (AWS SES)
   - Notification System

8. **Reporting & Compliance**
   - Analytics Dashboard
   - GDPR Reporting Tools

This sequence allows for early validation of core architecture, addresses high-risk areas first, and builds a foundation before adding specialized features.
