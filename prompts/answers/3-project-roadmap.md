## Critical Path Dependencies

The following dependencies represent the critical path for the project:

1. Core Infrastructure → Data Layer → Backend Core Services → Frontend Foundation → Member Management → Payment System → Advanced Features → Testing & Launch

## Parallel Development Opportunities

The following components can be developed in parallel to accelerate the timeline:

- Project Management can begin while Payment System is in development
- Communication System can begin while Project Management is in development
- Documentation can be developed throughout the project lifecycle

## Risk Mitigation Strategies

- Early proof-of-concepts for high-risk areas (authentication, offline capabilities, payment processing)
- Regular user feedback sessions after each phase
- Performance testing integrated throughout development
- Security review at the end of each major phase
