# eWegen Project Roadmap

## Overview

This roadmap outlines the development plan for eWegen (Ehrenamtswegen - Mitglieder Management Plattform), a three-tier application designed to help volunteers manage their charity organization. The project will be developed in phases, with each phase focusing on specific components and capabilities.

## Development Phases

### Phase 1: Foundation and Infrastructure (Months 1-2)

#### Components

- **Core Infrastructure Setup**
  - AWS account setup and configuration
  - Authentication framework (AWS Cognito)
  - CI/CD pipeline with GitHub Actions
  - Docker container configurations
  - Development environment setup

#### Milestones

- ✅ AWS infrastructure provisioned
- ✅ CI/CD pipeline operational - done
- ✅ Local development environment documented - done
- ✅ Authentication system proof-of-concept

#### Dependencies

- None (starting point)

#### Proof of Concept

- Simple authenticated API endpoint
- Basic Docker container deployment

#### Reasoning

Infrastructure and authentication are foundational elements that impact all other components. Starting here allows us to establish the security model early and create a stable deployment pipeline, reducing integration issues later. The authentication system is particularly critical as it affects both frontend and backend components, making it a logical starting point.

---

### Phase 2: Data Layer and Core Services (Months 2-4)

#### Components

- **Data Layer**
  - DynamoDB schema design
  - Core data models (Members, Projects, Payments)
  - Data access patterns
  - GDPR compliance mechanisms
  
- **Backend Core Services**
  - Member Management Service (Golang)
  - API Gateway/BFF Layer (TypeScript/Node.js)
  - Observability Framework

#### Milestones

- ✅ Data schema finalized
- ✅ Core API endpoints operational
- ✅ Basic CRUD operations for members
- ✅ Logging and monitoring in place

#### Dependencies

- Requires Core Infrastructure (Phase 1)

#### Proof of Concept

- End-to-end API test for member creation and retrieval
- Demonstration of GDPR-compliant data storage

#### Reasoning

Data architecture is the backbone of the application and impacts all feature development. Building core backend services early creates a foundation for all subsequent business logic. The Member Management Service is prioritized first because members are the central entity that other features (payments, projects, communications) depend on. Starting with the data layer also forces early consideration of GDPR compliance requirements.

---

### Phase 3: Frontend Foundation (Months 4-6)

#### Components

- **Frontend Core**
  - Project setup (React/Gatsby + TailwindCSS)
  - UI Component Library
  - Authentication integration
  - Internationalization framework
  - Basic responsive layouts

#### Milestones

- ✅ Frontend architecture established
- ✅ User authentication flow working
- ✅ Core UI components created
- ✅ Internationalization framework tested

#### Dependencies

- Requires Authentication (Phase 1)
- Requires API Gateway/BFF (Phase 2)

#### Proof of Concept

- Member login and profile viewing
- Language switching capability

#### Reasoning

After establishing the backend foundation, creating the frontend foundation allows for end-to-end testing of core workflows. Building a UI component library early ensures consistent design and accelerates later feature development. Internationalization is addressed early because retrofitting it later would require significant rework. This phase creates the scaffolding that all future UI features will build upon.

---

### Phase 4: Member Management (Months 6-8)

#### Components

- **Member Management Features**
  - Member registration flow
  - Member profile management
  - Member search and filtering
  - Membership status tracking
  - Offline data capabilities

#### Milestones

- ✅ Complete member management UI
- ✅ Member data synchronization
- ✅ Member status workflows
- ✅ First end-to-end user journeys

#### Dependencies

- Requires Frontend Foundation (Phase 3)
- Requires Member Management Service (Phase 2)

#### Reasoning

Member management represents the core business functionality and the foundation for other features. By completing this module first, we deliver immediate value to users while establishing patterns for other features. The offline capabilities built here will inform how we handle offline mode for other features. This phase produces a minimally viable product that delivers real value even without the other planned features.

---

### Phase 5: Payment System (Months 8-10)

#### Components

- **Payment Processing**
  - Payment Management Service (Golang)
  - Recurring Payment Scheduler
  - Payment tracking and reporting
  - Payment history views

#### Milestones

- ✅ Payment processing workflows
- ✅ Recurring payment setup
- ✅ Payment reporting dashboards

#### Dependencies

- Requires Member Management (Phase 4)

#### Proof of Concept

- End-to-end payment processing demonstration
- Recurring payment lifecycle test

#### Reasoning

Payments are a critical revenue function for the charity and build directly on member management. This module involves complex business logic and financial data, making it higher risk than some other features. Implementing it after the core member functionality allows us to focus on the financial accuracy and security aspects without being distracted by more basic functionality concerns.

---

### Phase 6: Project Management (Months 10-12)

#### Components

- **Project Tracking**
  - Project Management Service (Golang)
  - Project creation and assignment
  - Fulfillment tracking
  - Project reporting

#### Milestones

- ✅ Project creation and management
- ✅ Project assignment to members
- ✅ Fulfillment tracking dashboard

#### Dependencies

- Requires Member Management (Phase 4)
- Can parallel with Payment System (Phase 5)

#### Reasoning

Project management is a core operational function that depends on member data but is independent of the payment system. We schedule it after payments because financial systems typically have higher priority for charities. However, it can be developed in parallel with the payment system if resources allow. This module enables the charity to track its actual support activities, completing the core business functionality triad (members, payments, projects).

---

### Phase 7: Communication System (Months 12-14)

#### Components

- **Communication**
  - Email Service integration (AWS SES)
  - Notification templates
  - Communication preferences
  - Scheduled communications

#### Milestones

- ✅ Email templates created
- ✅ Notification system operational
- ✅ Communication preferences management

#### Dependencies

- Requires Member Management (Phase 4)
- Can parallel with Project Management (Phase 6)

#### Proof of Concept

- Email notification flow demonstration
- Bulk communication capability

#### Reasoning

The communication system enhances the core functionality rather than being essential to basic operations. It's placed later in the roadmap because it depends on having member data but doesn't block other core features. Email configuration and template design are relatively independent tasks that can be developed in parallel with other features. This module completes the outreach capabilities of the system.

---

### Phase 8: Advanced Features and Compliance (Months 14-16)

#### Components

- **Reporting & Compliance**
  - Analytics Dashboard
  - GDPR Reporting Tools
  - Data archiving implementation
  - Advanced search capabilities

- **Offline Capabilities**
  - Enhanced offline synchronization
  - Conflict resolution
  - Offline mode improvements

#### Milestones

- ✅ Compliance reporting dashboard
- ✅ Data archiving and retention policies implemented
- ✅ Full offline capability tested
- ✅ System performance optimization

#### Dependencies

- Requires all previous phases

#### Reasoning

Advanced features are scheduled after core functionality is complete because they enhance rather than define the system. GDPR compliance mechanisms were considered from the beginning, but comprehensive reporting tools are best implemented once all data-generating features are in place. Similarly, advanced offline capabilities build upon the basic offline functionality established earlier. This phase focuses on polishing the system and ensuring regulatory compliance.

---

### Phase 9: Testing, Documentation and Launch (Months 16-18)

#### Components

- **Testing**
  - End-to-end testing
  - Performance testing
  - Security testing
  - Accessibility testing

- **Documentation**
  - User documentation
  - Admin documentation
  - API documentation
  - Operational runbooks

#### Milestones

- ✅ Testing completed
- ✅ Documentation finalized
- ✅ User training materials created
- ✅ Production deployment

#### Dependencies

- Requires all previous phases

#### Reasoning

While testing occurs throughout development, comprehensive system testing is scheduled as a dedicated phase before launch to ensure all components work together as expected. Documentation is consolidated at this stage to ensure it accurately reflects the final system. This phase represents the final quality gate before full production deployment and focuses on ensuring the system is robust, well-documented, and ready for handover to operational teams.

## Critical Path Dependencies

The following dependencies represent the critical path for the project:

1. Core Infrastructure → Data Layer → Backend Core Services → Frontend Foundation → Member Management → Payment System → Advanced Features → Testing & Launch

## Parallel Development Opportunities

The following components can be developed in parallel to accelerate the timeline:

- Project Management can begin while Payment System is in development
- Communication System can begin while Project Management is in development
- Documentation can be developed throughout the project lifecycle

## Risk Mitigation Strategies

- Early proof-of-concepts for high-risk areas (authentication, offline capabilities, payment processing)
- Regular user feedback sessions after each phase
- Performance testing integrated throughout development
- Security review at the end of each major phase
