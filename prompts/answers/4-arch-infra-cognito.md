# Authentication/Authorization Architecture with AWS Cognito

## 1. Main Functionalities

The authentication component needs to support:

- User registration and sign-up flows
- Authentication (login/logout)
- Password management (reset, change)
- Multi-factor authentication
- Role-based access control
- Token management (JWT)
- Session management
- Social identity provider integration

**Reasoning**: These core functionalities cover the full authentication lifecycle while supporting the volunteer-based nature of the organization. Role-based access is essential for differentiating between regular volunteers and administrators.

## 2. Data Structures/Models

- **User**: Basic profile (email, name, status)
- **Role**: Admin, Volunteer, ReadOnly
- **Permission**: Fine-grained access controls
- **UserGroup**: For organizational structure
- **TokenPayload**: Contains claims for authorization

**Reasoning**: Keeping these models lean but extensible allows for appropriate access control without overcomplicating the data model. The separation of roles and permissions enables granular access control while maintaining flexibility.

## 3. Key Classes/Modules

- **AuthService**: Central facade for authentication operations
- **CognitoAdapter**: Implements AWS Cognito integration
- **TokenManager**: Handles JWT validation and refresh
- **PermissionEvaluator**: Determines access rights
- **AuthContextProvider**: Frontend state management
- **AuthMiddleware**: Backend request authorization

**Reasoning**: This structure follows the adapter pattern to isolate Cognito-specific code, making future provider changes possible. The separation of concerns between authentication and authorization provides clear boundaries of responsibility.

## 4. Component Interactions

```d2
Frontend ↔ BFF Layer ↔ Cognito
  ↓           ↓
UI Context    Auth Middleware
  ↓           ↓
Protected    Backend Services
Components
```

**Reasoning**: This flow centralizes authentication through the BFF layer, which acts as a security gateway. This prevents direct Cognito access from frontend code and allows for consistent token handling across the application.

## 5. Design Patterns

- **Adapter Pattern**: Isolate Cognito-specific code
- **Facade Pattern**: Simplify auth interface
- **Strategy Pattern**: Support multiple auth methods
- **Decorator Pattern**: Add authorization checks
- **Observer Pattern**: React to auth state changes

**Reasoning**: These patterns support maintainability by decoupling the system from Cognito's specific implementation, while enabling extensibility for future auth requirements and providing clean interfaces for other components.

## 6. Scalability & Maintainability

- Use Cognito User Pools for user directory
- Implement token caching to reduce API calls
- Set up appropriate Cognito rate limits
- Create reusable auth components and hooks
- Implement comprehensive auth logging
- Establish auth testing patterns

**Reasoning**: These considerations address both technical scaling (Cognito's managed service handles the load) and development scaling (reusable components reduce duplication). Comprehensive logging supports troubleshooting in a distributed environment.
