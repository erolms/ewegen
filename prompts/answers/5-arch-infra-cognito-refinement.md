## 1. Potential Drawbacks/Limitations

- **Vendor Lock-in**: Deep Cognito integration creates AWS dependency
- **Limited Customization**: Cognito has fixed authentication flows
- **Offline Challenges**: Cloud-based auth complicates offline scenarios
- **Cost Scaling**: Cognito pricing increases with user count
- **Learning Curve**: Team needs Cognito-specific knowledge
- **Migration Complexity**: Changing providers later becomes difficult

**Reasoning**: While Cognito offers managed security and compliance benefits, these limitations impact flexibility and could create technical debt if requirements change significantly.

## 2. Alternative Flexible Design

- **Authentication Gateway Pattern**: Abstract auth layer separate from providers
- **Provider Interface**: Define standard contract for auth providers
- **Claims-Based Identity**: Focus on standardized claims rather than provider-specific models
- **Token Service Abstraction**: Provider-agnostic token validation/generation
- **Multiple Identity Provider Support**: Design for potential multi-provider scenarios

**Reasoning**: This approach sacrifices some initial development speed for significantly improved flexibility. By focusing on abstractions rather than implementations, we can more easily adapt to changing requirements or providers.

## 3. Changes for Different Auth Backend

- **Replace Only Adapter Layer**: Keep business logic intact
- **Standard OAuth/OIDC**: Use industry standards for auth flows
- **Provider Factory**: Runtime selection of auth provider implementation
- **Configuration-Driven**: Auth behavior controlled via configuration
- **Portable User Data**: Minimize provider-specific user attributes

**Reasoning**: This modification creates clearer separation between the authentication mechanism and its implementation. By using standard protocols and keeping provider-specific code isolated, switching providers becomes a contained change rather than a system-wide refactoring.
